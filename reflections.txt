# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
I used table_print because I wanted to be able to print list details in a table. 
I modified table_print by sourcing a repo I forked.
I did this because table_print prints the string "Method Missing" whenever
the expected content for a column is unavailable. In this project, not
all events have the same details, so I needed those spaces to just be 
empty instead of saying "Method Missing." 

2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) I added a filter_by_priority method for todo items 
  b) I added a filter_by_due_date method for todo items 


# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
I have been working on this project slowly over the last two weeks.
I have been reading a lot about modules lately, so that part was pretty easy
and gems were more challenging. 

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Modifying table_print was very exciting and rewarding. It took me a while and 
a bit of research to determine the best method for doing so, and I felt very
excited when my modifications worked the way I wanted them to. 

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
I added a filter_by_priority method for todo items to enable the user to prioritize their tasks.
I added a filter_by_due_date method for todo items for the same reason. 
These two features seemed like the most intuitive and obvious features a user would desire. 


4. Where do you still have room to grow?
I know it would have been MUCH more challenging to build this project from
scratch, so generally, I know I still have some room to grow as far as 
creating classes and writing class methods is concerned. I also feel 
uncertain about whether or not my code could still stand to be refactored,
and sometimes I am uncertain about whether or not the variables I create
in methods should be instance variables.
